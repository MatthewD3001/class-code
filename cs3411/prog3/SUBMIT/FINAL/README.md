Test 1:
-------
For this test I simply encoded my "encode" file. 
The gz file is 4916 bytes.
My encoded file is 16110 bytes.
The compression ratio here is 16110/4916 = 3.277

Test 2:
-------
For this test I encoded the provided "bitops.c" file. 
The gz file is 665 bytes.
My encoded file is 1927 bytes.
The compression ratio here is 1927/665 = 2.8977

Test 3:
-------
For this test I encoded the provided "constitution.txt" file. 
The gz file is 14030 bytes.
My encoded file is 45057 bytes.
The compression ratio here is 45057/14030 = 3.211
