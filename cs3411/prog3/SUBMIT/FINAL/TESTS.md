CS3411 R01 Prog 3
=================
Test 1:
-------
For this test I simply encoded the provided "hello.txt" file. 
I then compared this to the provided encoded file and found it was equal.
After I then decoded this file with my progam and found that i got the exact same original file.

Test 2:
-------
For this test I encoded the provided "constitution.txt" file. 
I then compared this to the provided constitution file to find that they were the same.
I also decoded this and then compared against the original, they were again the exact same.

Test 3:
-------
For this test I encoded the provided "FGSA" file. 
I then compared this to the given encoded file and they were exactly the same.
Unfortunately I was unable to reproduce the original with the decode though, always differed on byte 19.
