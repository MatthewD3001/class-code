Logger Testing:
---------------
In order to test the logger I had two terminals open. On both I would write until I knew the log file had over 128 bytes of data in it. Then on one terminal I would enter the list command. On the other terminal, after the first was waiting for the user to press enter, I would log another line. Then on the first terminal I would press enter to check if that last line was added, which it was.
